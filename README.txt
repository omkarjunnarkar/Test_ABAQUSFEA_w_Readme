Aim : To compare the results of FEA of 2 Bar Geometry considering cases of Material '0' & Material '1' in terms of Displacement and Stress-Strain behaviour with ABAQUS Simulation.

Expected Results : The Stress-Strain behaviour of the considered problem should be similar to the results found in TestCases_FEA_2Bar/Test_Mat_Properties/Mat0 and  TestCases_FEA_2Bar/Test_Mat_Properties/Mat1

Obtained Result : Using input data Job-Mat0.inp & Job-Mat1.inp, the results obtained are stored in Job-Mat0.odb & Job-Mat1.odb. Also, the plot for stress-strain and displacement for 'Mat0' & 'Mat1' are Mat0_Graph/Stress.jpg & Mat1_Graph/Stress.jpg respectively.

Conclusion : The Results obtained from the FEA_2ELE_Problem code are similar to that of obtained from the ABAQUS SImulation.
